## Code Execution Improvements

_March 6th, 2024_

We've made some huge improvements to code execution! You can now include custom packages for code execution workflow nodes and code execution eval metrics. On top of this, we have added support for TypeScript. You can select the programming language you want from the new "Runtime" dropdown.

We have also introduced a few smaller improvements:
- The maximum size for code input values has been increased to 10mb, a significant leap from the previous cap of 128k characters
- The layout of the workflow code execution node editor has been revamped with a new side by side layout
- All Vellum input types are now supported for code execution node input variables
- Line numbers in the code editor will no longer be squished together

## Retrieve Workflow Deployment API

_March 1st, 2024_

We've exposed a new API endpoint to retrieve details of a Workflow Deployment. This is useful if you want to do things like programmatically detect if a Workflow Deployment with a specific name exists, or has the inputs/outputs you expect.
You can find the details of the API [here](https://docs.vellum.ai/api-reference/api-reference/workflow-deployments/retrieve).
