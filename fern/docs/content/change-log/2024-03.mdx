## Retrieve Workflow Deployment API

_March 1st, 2024_

We've exposed a new API endpoint to retrieve details of a Workflow Deployment. This is useful if you want to do things like programmatically detect if a Workflow Deployment with a specific name exists, or has the inputs/outputs you expect.
You can find the details of the API [here](https://docs.vellum.ai/api-reference/api-reference/workflow-deployments/retrieve).
