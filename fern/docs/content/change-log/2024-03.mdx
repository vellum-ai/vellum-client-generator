## Code Execution Improvements

_March 5th, 2024_

We've made some huge improvements to code execution! You can now include custom packages for code execution workflow nodes and code execution eval metrics. On top of this, we have added support for TypeScript. You can select the language you want from the new "Runtime" dropdown.

We have also introduced a couple smaller improvements. The maximum capacity for code input values has been expanded to 10mb, a significant leap from the previous cap of 128k characters. Additionally, the layout of the workflow code node editor has been revamped.
