## Code Execution Improvements

_March 5th, 2024_

We've made some huge improvements to code execution! You can now include custom packages for code execution workflow nodes and code execution eval metrics. On top of this, we have added support for TypeScript. You can select the programming language you want from the new "Runtime" dropdown.

We have also introduced a few smaller improvements:
- The maximum size for code input values has been increased to 10mb, a significant leap from the previous cap of 128k characters
- The layout of the workflow code execution node editor has been revamped
- All Vellum input types are now supported for code execution node input variables
- Line numbers in the code editor will no longer be squished together
