## In-Progress Workflows Executions Now Available in Monitoring

_March 6th, 2024_

You previously had to wait for a workflow to fully resolve before seeing it in the Workflow Executions table. We now start publishing executions as soon as Workflows are initiated! This allows users building complex Workflows to see any that are still in progress:

We also updated the Workflow Execution Details page to also reflect in progress workflows:

## Expand Scenario in Prompt Sandbox

_March 6th, 2024_

Looking for more room to edit your scenarios in the prompt sandbox? We've just added an expand scenario modal! You can now easily make changes to scenarios with longer inputs.

## Code Execution Logs

_March 6th, 2024_

You can now use `print` or `console.log` statements in code execution nodes and view the logs by looking at a node's result and clicking the logs tab.

We've also added logs for eval metrics. You can view them by enabling the logs column in the table columns settings.

## Code Execution Improvements

_March 6th, 2024_

We've made some huge improvements to code execution! You can now include custom packages for code execution workflow nodes and code execution eval metrics. On top of this, we have added support for TypeScript. You can select the programming language you want from the new "Runtime" dropdown.

We have also introduced a few smaller improvements:

- The maximum size for code input values has been increased to 10mb, a significant leap from the previous cap of 128k characters
- The layout of the workflow code execution node editor has been revamped with a new side by side layout
- All Vellum input types are now supported for code execution node input variables
- Line numbers in the code editor will no longer be squished together

## Claude 3

_March 5th, 2024_

Anthropic's two newest models, Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3 Sonnet, are now both available in Vellum! These models have been added to all workspaces so they should be selectable from prompt sandboxes upon refresh.

## Chat Widget Now Opened by Get Help Button

_March 5th, 2024_

It used to be that the Chat Widget we showed in the bottom right corner of the screen would get in the way of other actions like Save buttons.
Now, that Chat Widget is hidden by default and you can open it by clicking the "Get Help" button in the side navigation. The Chat Widget
also has useful links bookmarked like the Vellum Help Docs.

## Workflow Error Nodes

_March 4th, 2024_

It's now possible to terminal a Workflow and raise an error through the use of Error Nodes. You can either re-raise an error from an upstream node, or construct and raise a custom error message.

## Retrieve Workflow Deployment API

_March 1st, 2024_

We've exposed a new API endpoint to retrieve details of a Workflow Deployment. This is useful if you want to do things like programmatically detect if a Workflow Deployment with a specific name exists, or has the inputs/outputs you expect.
You can find the details of the API [here](https://docs.vellum.ai/api-reference/api-reference/workflow-deployments/retrieve).
