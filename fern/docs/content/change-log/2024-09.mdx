## New and Improved Code Editor

_September 3rd, 2024_

We now use [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) for our code editor used by Workflow Code Nodes and custom Code Evaluation Metrics.

Monaco is the same editor that VSCode uses under the hood. This offers a number of improvements including intellisense, semantic validation and syntax validation.
Additionally we now inject Vellum Value types into the editor, so you can now have fully typed inputs for things such as Chat History. Some of these improvements
are currently only available for TypeScript and not Python.
