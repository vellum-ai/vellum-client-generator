## Default Block Type Preference

_September 4th, 2024_

You can now set a default Block type for use throughout the app. Whenever you see the "Add Block" or "Add Message" options in a Prompt Editor, your preferred Block type will be used.

By default, the Block type is set to "Rich Text," the newer option that supports Variable Chips. You can still switch between Block types for individual Blocks within the Prompt Editor.

## New and Improved Code Editor

_September 3rd, 2024_

We now use [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) for our code editor that is used by Workflow Code Nodes and custom Code Evaluation Metrics.
Monaco is the same editor that Visual Studio Code uses under the hood.

This offers a number of improvements including IntelliSense, semantic validation and syntax validation. Additionally we now inject Vellum Value types into the editor,
so you can now have fully typed input values for things such as Chat History. Some of these improvements are currently only available for TypeScript and not Python.

## VPC Disable gVisor Option for Code Execution

_September 3rd, 2024_

VPC customers of Vellum can now disable gVisor sandboxing for code execution in self-hosted environments to significantly improve the performance of Code Nodes in Workflows.
gVisor is needed for secure sandboxing in our Managed SASS platform, but in a self hosted environment where you're the only organization,
it's not strictly required if you trust that users within your org won't run malicious code.
