## Cost Tracking for Prompt Deployment Executions Table

_September 17th 2024_

You can now see your cost for Prompt Executions in your Prompt Executions Table!

![cost_tracking_prompt_executions](https://storage.googleapis.com/vellum-public/help-docs/changelogs/2024-09/prompt_executions_cost_tracking.png)

This should enable deeper optimization and performance analysis for your prompts, as well as provider further
transparency for your resource usage.

## Optimized Prompt Deployment Executions Table

_September 13th 2024_

This update brings a reduction in load times for filters and sorts; in some instances, dropping 2 minute load times to a
few seconds.

We've achieved this by switching to a more efficient data source, enabling more effective filtering and sorting
capabilities. You'll notice faster page load times across the board, resulting in a smoother, more responsive experience
when working with Prompt Deployment Executions.

This optimization sets the stage for exciting new features we have in the works. Stay tuned for more updates that
will enhance your ability to analyze, and optimize your prompt executions.


## External ID Filtering for Workflow Deployment Executions

_September 13th, 2024_

Previously, when filtering workflow deployment executions by external IDs, you had to provide the exact string match
to retrieve relevant results.

Now, you can filter external IDs using a variety of string patterns. You can specify that the external ID
should start with, end with, or contain certain substrings. This enhancement allows for more flexible filtering,
making it easier to locate specific workflow deployment executions based on partial matches.

## Workflow Execution Timeline View Revamp

_September 13th, 2024_

We have given the Workflow Execution Timeline View a bit of a facelift. Along with a more modern look, we have added a couple quality of life improvements:

- **Subworkflows**: Instead of needing to navigate to a separate page, you can now expand subworkflows to view their executions details within the same page.
- **Node Pages**: Instead of cluttering the page with the details of all nodes at once, we now display the details for just one node at a time. Click on a node to view its inputs, outputs, and more. Each node has its own permalink so that you can share the url with others.

## OpenAI Strawberry (o1) Models

_September 12th, 2024_

OpenAI's newest [Strawberry (o1) models](https://openai.com/o1/) `o1-preview`, `o1-mini`, `o1-preview-2024-09-12`, & `o1-mini-2024-09-12` are now available in Vellum and have been added to all workspaces!

## Interactive Pages in Single Editor Mode ##

_September 7th, 2024_

It used to be that when two people were on the same Prompt/Workflow Sandbox, only one person could edit and interact with the page.
If you were a Viewer, you were unable to interact with the page at all and were blocked with a big page overlay.

Now, the page overlay is gone and Viewers can interact with the page in a read-only mode and perform actions that
don't affect the state of the page. This includes things like scrolling, opening modals, copying text, etc.

## Expand Cost in Execute Prompt APIs ##

_September 4th, 2024_

You can now opt in to receive the cost of a Prompt's execution in the response of the [Execute Prompt](/api-reference/prompts/execute-prompt#request.body.expand_meta.cost) and
[Execute Prompt Stream](/api-reference/prompts/execute-prompt-stream#request.body.expand_meta.cost) APIs.

This is helpful if you want to capture the cost of executing a Prompt in your own system or if you want to provide cost
transparency to your end users.

To opt in, you can pass the `expand_meta` field in the request body with the `cost` key set to `true`.
```json
{
  ...,
  "expand_meta" : {
    "cost": true
  }
}
```

You can expect a corresponding value to be included in the meta field on the response:
```json
{
  ...,
  "meta": {
    "cost" : {
        "value" : 0.000450003,
        "unit" : "USD"
    }
  }
}
```

This functionality is available in our SDKs beginning v0.8.9.

## Default Block Type Preference

_September 4th, 2024_

You can now set a default Block type to use when defining Prompts in Vellum. Whenever you see the "Add Block" or "Add Message" options in a Prompt Editor, your preferred Block type will be used.

By default, the Block type is set to "Rich Text," the newer option that supports Variable Chips. You can still switch between Block types for individual Blocks within the Prompt Editor.

## New and Improved Code Editor

_September 3rd, 2024_

We now use [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) for our code editor that is used by Workflow Code Nodes and custom Code Evaluation Metrics.
Monaco is the same editor that Visual Studio Code uses under the hood.

This offers a number of improvements including IntelliSense, semantic validation and syntax validation. Additionally we now inject Vellum Value types into the editor,
so you can now have fully typed input values for things such as Chat History. Some of these improvements are currently only available for TypeScript and not Python.

## VPC Disable gVisor Option for Code Execution

_September 3rd, 2024_

VPC customers of Vellum can now disable gVisor sandboxing for code execution in self-hosted environments to significantly improve the performance of Code Nodes in Workflows.
gVisor is needed for secure sandboxing in our Managed SASS platform, but in a self hosted environment where you're the only organization,
it's not strictly required if you trust that users within your org won't run malicious code.

## Download Original Document from UI

_September 2nd, 2024_

You can now download a file that was originally uploaded as a Document to a Document Index from the UI.
You'll find a new "Download Original" option in a Document's ••• More Menu.
