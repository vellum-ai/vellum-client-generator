## New and Improved Code Editor

_September 3rd, 2024_

We now use [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) for our code editor that is used by Workflow Code Nodes and custom Code Evaluation Metrics.
Monaco is the same editor that Visual Studio Code uses under the hood.

This offers a number of improvements including IntelliSense, semantic validation and syntax validation. Additionally we now inject Vellum Value types into the editor,
so you can now have fully typed input values for things such as Chat History. Some of these improvements are currently only available for TypeScript and not Python.

## VPC Disable gVisor Option for Code Execution

_September 3rd, 2024_

You can now disable gVisor sandboxing for code execution in your self hosted environment to significantly improve performance.
gVisor is needed for secure sandboxing in our Managed SASS platform but in a self hosted environment where you are the only organization
it is not strictly required if you trust your co-workers.
