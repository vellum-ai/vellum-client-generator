## New Layout for Sandbox Evaluations

_July 17th, 2024_

Previously all Sandbox Evaluations were loaded at once resulting in poor performance and difficulty navigating between them. As a first step in improving the experience, we've updated the page with a searchable select that allows you to easily load and view a single table at a time.

## New "Add Document to Document Index" API

_July 16th, 2024_

We've introduced a new API for adding previously uploaded Documents to a Document Index. This API is useful when you have a Document that
had previously been added to one Document Index and you want to add it to another without having to re-upload its contents altogether. It's available in our SDKs
beginning version 0.6.10. You can find docs for this new API [here](/api-reference/document-indexes/add-document).


## Prompt Deployment Executions Table Improvements

_July 12th, 2024_

We've made several quality-of-life enhancements to the Prompt Deployment Executions table, simplifying the process of adding and editing 'Desired Output' values. The entire table has been updated to align with the design of our other tables, such as Evaluations, ensuring a familiar editing experience. Additionally, it is now easier than ever to expand/collapse and copy values.

Moreover, we've significantly improved the consistency and usability of the 'Quality' column. You can now edit quality ratings with a single click, and the 'Desired Output' column will automatically update to reflect your rating where applicable.

## Constant Values in Workflow Node Inputs
_July 11th, 2024_

It's often the case that you might want to specify a constant value as a Workflow Node Input, either as the input's primary value or as its fallback value.
The solution up until now was to specify a Templating Node, have it output a constant value, and then feed its output to the downstream Node.

Today, we are releasing the ability to inline constant values directly within Workflow Node inputs! First, start typing in the Node Input until the no options modal shows:

A modal will appear to specify your value:

Upon confirming, Vellum will use an icon to denote that the input value represents a constant. As part of this work, we also added icons for all other Node Input types:

Note that constant values will always drop to the last fallback option of a given Node input, and there can only be maximum one constant defined per input.
This is due to the nature fallback values – fallbacks are only used if other values aren't available (i.e. the node that produced the value hadn't executed yet). In the case of constants, their values are always present.

## Test Case CSV Upload in Evaluation Reports

_July 9th, 2024_

We’ve introduced the ability to upload Test Cases to a Test Suite directly from within the Evaluations tab of a Prompt or Workflow.  Now, you'll find an "Upload Test Cases" button in the table header of every Evaluations table, for both Workflows and Prompt Sandboxes whereas previously, you needed to first navigate to the Test Suite itself and upload from there.

## Index Page List View

_July 3rd, 2024_

We’ve introduced a list-view toggle to the index/file browser pages for Prompts, Documents, Test Suites, and Workflows. Your preferred view will be saved automatically by entity type, allowing you to, for instance, default to list view for Prompts and grid view for Documents.

## Collapsible Index Page Sections

_July 2nd, 2024_

You can now collapse sections on the index/file browser pages for Prompts, Documents, Test Suites, and Workflows. Simply click the heading of any section to toggle the visibility of all folders and items within that section.
