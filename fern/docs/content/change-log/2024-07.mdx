## Constant Values in Workflow Node Inputs
_July 11th, 2024_

It's often the case that a user would want to specify a constant value into a Workflow Node Input, either as the primary value or as a fallback value.
The solution up until now was specifying a Templating Node, ensuring that this Node was in the execution path, and feeding its output into a Node's input.

Today, we are releasing the ability to directly define a constant to a Workflow Node! First, start typing in the Node Input until the no options modal shows:

A modal will appear to specify your value:

Upon confirm, we use a constant specific icon to denote that an input is from a constant. As part of this work, we also brought inline the option icon
for all other Node Input types:

Note that constant values will always drop to the last option of a given Node input, and there could only be maximum one constant defined per input.
This is because of the nature of how fallbacks work: if there's a constant defined, it can't be definition fallback to the next option.
