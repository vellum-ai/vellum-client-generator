## Constant Values in Workflow Node Inputs
_July 11th, 2024_

It's often the case that you might want to specify a constant value as a Workflow Node Input, either as the input's primary value or as its fallback value.
The solution up until now was to specify a Templating Node, have it output a constant value, and then feed its output to the downstream Node.

Today, we are releasing the ability to inline constant values directly within Workflow Node inputs! First, start typing in the Node Input until the no options modal shows:

A modal will appear to specify your value:

Upon confirming, Vellum will use an icon to denote that the input value represents a constant. As part of this work, we also added icons for all other Node Input types:

![Constant Value Display](https://storage.googleapis.com/vellum-public/help-docs/changelogs/2024-07/constant-value-display.png)

Note that constant values will always drop to the last fallback option of a given Node input, and there can only be maximum one constant defined per input.
This is due to the nature fallback values â€“ fallbacks are only used if other values aren't available (i.e. the node that produced the value hadn't executed yet). In the case of constants, their values are always present.
