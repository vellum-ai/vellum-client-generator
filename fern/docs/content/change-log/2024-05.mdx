## Subworkflow Node Streaming

_May 7th, 2024_

Subworkflow Nodes can now stream their output(s) to parent workflows.

This allows you to compose workflows using modular subworkflows without sacrificing the ability to delivery incremental results to your end user.

Note that only nodes immediately prior to Final Output Nodes can have their output(s) streamed.

## Default Test Case Concurrency in Evaluations

_May 4th, 2024_

You can now configure how many Test Cases should be run in parallel during an Evaluation. You might lower this value
if you're running into rate limits from the LLM provider, or might increase this value if your rate limits are high.
