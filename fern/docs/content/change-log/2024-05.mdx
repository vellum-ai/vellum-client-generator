## Run All Button on Evaluation Reports

_May 10th, 2024_

There's now a "Run All" button on evaluation reports that runs a test suite for all variants. Instead of running each variant individually, you can now run them all with one click.

## Prompt Node Monitoring

_May 9th, 2024_

Vellum is now capturing monitoring data for deployed Prompt Nodes. Whenever a deployed Workflow invokes a Prompt Node, it will now show a link displaying the Prompt Deployment label:

Clicking on the link will take you to the _Prompt's executions_ page, where you can then see all metadata captured for the execution, including the raw request data sent to the model:

## Groq Support

_May 9th, 2024_

Vellum now has a native integration with the LPU Inference Engine, [Groq](https://groq.com/). All public models on Groq are now available to add to your workspace. Be sure to add your API key as a Secret named `GROQ_API_KEY` on the [API Keys page](https://app.vellum.ai/api-keys).

Groq is an LLM hosting provider that offers incredible inference speed for open source LLMs, including the recently released (and very hyped!) [Llama 3](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/) model.

## Function Calling in Prompt Evaluation

_May 8th, 2024_

Prompts that output function calls can now be evaluated via Test Suites. This allows you to define Test Cases consisting of the inputs to the prompt, and the expected function call, then assert that there's a match. For more, check out our [docs](/help-center/evaluation/quantitative-evaluation#function-calling).

## Out-of-Box Ragas Metrics

_May 7th, 2024_

Test-driven development for your RAG-based LLM pipelines is now easier than ever within Vellum!

Three new [Ragas metrics](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/index.html) – [Context Revelancy](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/context_relevancy.html), [Answer Relevance](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/answer_relevance.html) and [Faithfulness](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/faithfulness.html) – are now available out-of-box in Vellum. These can be used within Workflow Evaluations to measure the quality of a RAG system.

For more info, check out our new help center article on [Evaluating RAG Pipelines](/help-center/evaluation/evaluating-rag-pipelines).

## Subworkflow Node Streaming

_May 7th, 2024_

Subworkflow Nodes can now stream their output(s) to parent workflows.

This allows you to compose workflows using modular subworkflows without sacrificing the ability to delivery incremental results to your end user.

Note that only nodes immediately prior to Final Output Nodes can have their output(s) streamed.

## Default Test Case Concurrency in Evaluations

_May 4th, 2024_

You can now configure how many Test Cases should be run in parallel during an Evaluation. You might lower this value
if you're running into rate limits from the LLM provider, or might increase this value if your rate limits are high.
