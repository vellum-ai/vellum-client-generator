## Image Support in Claude 3 and Gemini Models

_June 3rd, 2024_

Until now, GPT-4 was the only multi-modal family of models supported in Vellum that let you parse images and return text.

Vellum now also supports multi-modality for Claude 3 and Gemini models. This means you can now use Vellum's prompt comparison UI and normalized API layer to compare and easily swap between multi-modal models.

This is particularly useful if you're trying to extract text from images, classify pictures, and more, and need to find the best model for your specific use-case.

For more on how to work with images in Vellum, see our [help docs here](/help-center/prompts/images).
