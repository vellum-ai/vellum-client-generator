## Prompt Caching Support for OpenAI

Today OpenAI introduced [Prompt Caching](https://openai.com/index/api-prompt-caching/) for GPT-4o and o1 models. Subsequent invocations of the same prompt will produce outputs with lower latency and up to 50% reduced costs.

To follow this, we've begun capturing cache tokens in Vellum's monitoring layer. With this update, you'll now see the number of Prompt Cache Tokens used by a Prompt Deployment's executions if it's backed by an OpenAI model.
This new monitoring data can be used to help analyze your cache hit rate with OpenAI and optimize your LLM spend.


## Online Evaluations for Workflow and Prompt Deployments

We're excited to announce the launch of [Online Evaluations for Workflow and Prompt Deployments](/help/evaluation/online-evaluations)! This new feature allows you to configure metrics for your deployments to be evaluated in real-time as they're executed. Key highlights include:

- **Continuous Assessment**: Automatically evaluate the quality of your deployed LLM applications as they handle live requests.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Set up multiple metrics to assess different aspects of your deployment's performance.
- **Easy Access to Results**: View evaluation results directly in the execution details of your deployments.

To get started with Online Evaluations:
1. Deploy your Workflow or Prompt.
2. Navigate to the "Metrics" tab in your deployment.
