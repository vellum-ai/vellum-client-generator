## Online Evaluations for Workflow and Prompt Deployments

__October 3rd, 2024__

We're excited to announce the launch of [Online Evaluations for Workflow and Prompt Deployments](/help-center/evaluation/online-evaluations)! This new feature allows you to configure Metrics for your Deployments to be evaluated in real-time as they're executed. Key highlights include:

- **Continuous Assessment**: Automatically evaluate the quality of your deployed LLM applications as they handle live requests.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Set up multiple Metrics to assess different aspects of your Deployment's performance.
- **Easy Access to Results**: View evaluation results directly in the execution details of your Deployments.

It works by configuring Metrics for your Workflow or Prompt Deployment in the new "Metrics" tab.

Once configured, every execution of your Deployment will be evaluated against these Metrics. You can then view the results alongside the execution details.

## New Model Host: OpenRouter

__October 2nd, 2024__

We've added OpenRouter as a new model host in Vellum! OpenRouter provides access to a wide range of AI models through a single API, expanding the options of models available to our users.


### WizardLM Model Now Available

As part of our OpenRouter integration, we're pleased to introduce the [WizardLM-2 8x22B](https://openrouter.ai/models/microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b) model to our platform. WizardLM-2 8x22B is known for its strong performance across various natural language processing tasks and is now available for use in your Vellum projects.

These additions further expand the capabilities and flexibility of the Vellum platform, allowing you to leverage an even broader range of AI models for your applications.

## Prompt Caching Support for OpenAI

__October 2nd, 2024__

Today OpenAI introduced [Prompt Caching](https://openai.com/index/api-prompt-caching/) for GPT-4o and o1 models. Subsequent invocations of the same prompt will produce outputs with lower latency and up to 50% reduced costs.

To follow this, we've begun capturing cache tokens in Vellum's monitoring layer. With this update, you'll now see the number of Prompt Cache Tokens used by a Prompt Deployment's executions if it's backed by an OpenAI model.
This new monitoring data can be used to help analyze your cache hit rate with OpenAI and optimize your LLM spend.
