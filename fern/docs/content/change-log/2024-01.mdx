input, output, and total tokens used per request.

## Single Editor Mode
*January 25th, 2024*

We've collaborated with our friends at [velt.dev](https://velt.dev/) to deliver an all new "Single Editor Mode" in
Prompt and Workflow Sandboxes. Wit this, only one person can edit a Prompt/Workflow at a time and you can hand off
editing control to another collaborator. This is useful when you want to avoid conflicts when multiple people are
trying to edit the same Prompt/Workflow at the same time. Check out the video below to see it in action!

## API to Execute Workflow w/o Streaming
*January 23rd, 2024*

We've added a new API endpoint for executing a Workflow Deployment without streaming back its incremental results. This is useful
when you want to execute a Workflow and only care about its final result or if you're invoking your Workflow
via a service that doesn't support HTTP Streaming like Zapier.

## Image Support for OpenAI Vision Models
*January 18th, 2024*

Vellum now has API support for interacting with OpenAI's vision models, such as `gpt-4-vision-preview`.
You can learn more about OpenAI Vision models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision). Note that there is
limited support for images in the Vellum UI at this time, but you can still use the API to interact with OpenAI Vision models.
UI support coming soon!

*January 9th, 2024*

![API Key Metadata](https://storage.googleapis.com/vellum-public/help-docs/api-key-metadata.png)

Now you can add and view metadata for your Vellum API keys. For example, you can see when an API key was created and by whom.
You can also assign a label to an API key to help you keep track of its purpose and an environment tag so that you know
where it's used.

You can now find the following actions at the top-level of the Workflow and Prompt Deployment Execution pages:
- Save as Scenario: Useful for saving an edge case seen in production as a Scenario for qualitative eval.
- Save as Test Case: Useful for saving an edge case seen in production to your bank of Test Cases for quantitative eval.
- View Details: Drill in to see specifics about that specific Execution.

## Improved Error Messages in Code & API Nodes
*January 2nd, 2024*

![Improved Error Messages in Code & API Nodes](https://storage.googleapis.com/vellum-public/help-docs/workflow-api-node-code-node-error-messages.png)

API Nodes and Code Nodes within Workflows now have improved error messages. When an error occurs, the error message
will now include the line number and column number where the error occurred. This will make it easier to debug errors
in your Workflows.
