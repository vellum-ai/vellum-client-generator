## Prompt Deployment Usage Tracking
*January 29th, 2024*

Going forward, Vellum will now keep track of the token utilization of your Prompt Deployments. You can keep tabs on
input, output, and total tokens used per request.

You can also view this data in aggregate in the Monitoring tab.

This is a precursor to more advanced usage and billing features coming down the road. If there's more you'd like to see

## Single Editor Mode
*January 25th, 2024*

We've collaborated with our friends at [velt.dev](https://velt.dev/) to deliver an all new "Single Editor Mode" in
Prompt and Workflow Sandboxes. With this, only one person can edit a Prompt/Workflow at a time and you can hand off
editing control to another collaborator. This is useful for avoiding conflicts when multiple people are
trying to edit the same Prompt/Workflow at the same time. Check out the video below to see it in action!

## API to Execute Workflow w/o Streaming
*January 23rd, 2024*

We've added a new API endpoint for executing a Workflow Deployment without streaming back its incremental results. This is useful
when you want to execute a Workflow and only care about its final result or if you're invoking your Workflow
via a service that doesn't support HTTP Streaming like Zapier.

## Workflow Deployment Execution Visualization Improvements
*January 22nd, 2024*

Now, when visiting the details page for a Workflow Deployment Execution, you'll find an improved loading state as well
as a simplified view for Conditional Nodes.

## Upload/Download of Function Definitions
*January 18th, 2024*

You can now easily import your existing function definition files (JSON or YAML) into Vellum function calling blocks
as well as export functions you've already defined in Vellum to pass along to engineers for implementation. Check it
out below!

## Image Support for OpenAI Vision Models
*January 18th, 2024*

Vellum now has API support for interacting with OpenAI's vision models, such as `gpt-4-vision-preview`.
You can learn more about OpenAI Vision models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision). Note that there is
limited support for images in the Vellum UI at this time, but you can still use the API to interact with OpenAI Vision models.
UI support coming soon!

## Support for OpenAI JSON Mode, User ID, and Seed Params
*January 11th, 2024*

There is now native support for setting the `user` and `seed` parameters in OpenAI API requests, as well as specifying
that the response format be of type JSON. You can learn more about how these parameters are used by OpenAI in
their docs [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create).

## Cloning Workflow Scenarios
*January 9th, 2024*

You can now clone a Workflow Scenario to create a new Scenario based on an existing one. This is useful when you want to
create a new Scenario that is similar to an existing one, but with some changes.

## API Key Metadata
*January 9th, 2024*

Now you can add and view metadata for your Vellum API keys. For example, you can see when an API key was created and by whom.
You can also assign a label to an API key to help you keep track of its purpose and an environment tag so that you know
where it's used.

## Top-Level Workflow Execution Actions
*January 4th, 2024*

You can now find the following actions at the top-level of the Workflow and Prompt Deployment Execution pages:
- **Save as Scenario:** Useful for saving an edge case seen in production as a Scenario for qualitative eval.
- **Save as Test Case:** Useful for saving an edge case seen in production to your bank of Test Cases for quantitative eval.
- **View Details:** Drill in to see specifics about that specific Execution.

## Improved Error Messages in Code & API Nodes
*January 2nd, 2024*

API Nodes and Code Nodes within Workflows now have improved error messages. When an error occurs, the error message
will now include the line number and column number where the error occurred. This will make it easier to debug errors
in your Workflows.
