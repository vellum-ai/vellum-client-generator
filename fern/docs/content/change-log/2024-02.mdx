## Prompt Node Retries
*February 1st, 2024*

You can now detect when a Prompt Node within a Workflow errors by using a Conditional Node. Using this, you can now build out retry logic around Prompt Nodes within your Workflow! This is useful if you want to catch retryable errors (like rate limit errors from an LLM provider) and try making the call to the LLM again.

See a demo of it in action here:
