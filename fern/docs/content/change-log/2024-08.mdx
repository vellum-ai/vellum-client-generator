## GPT-4o 2024-08-06

OpenAI's newest GPT-4o model `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` is now available in Vellum and has been added to all workspaces!

## Deployment Descriptions

_August 2nd, 2024_

You can now update your Prompt and Workflow Deployments to include a human-readable description. This is useful for giving other members of your team a high-level summary
of what the Prompt or Workflow does without needing to parse through the configuration or control flow.

Once set, the description will appear as part of the Deployment Details page within the Deployment Info section:

## Evaluation Report History

_August 1st, 2024_

It used to be that you could only view the latest set of Evaluation results for a given Prompt or Workflow. But now,
you can view a history of all Evaluation runs and go back to view the results of any prior state.

This is particularly helpful if you want to do things like compare the results of two different Evaluation runs,
download the results of a past Evaluation run, or simply view the Test Cases that existed at that time.
