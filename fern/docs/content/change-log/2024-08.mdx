## Workflow Deployment Executions Filtered to Just API Executions

_August 12th, 2024_

Our Workflow Deployment Executions page used to list all executions of a Workflow Deployment, no matter where they were invoked from. However, this
would often get confusing because you'd see a mix of results from both eval runs and production traffic in the same view.

Our Workflow Deployment Executions page now filters down to just those executions that were invoked via the API. Executions from evaluations are still accessible from within the Evaluations UI by hovering over a row and clicking the "View Workflow Details" button:

## Add Specific Releases to Evaluation Reports

_August 12th, 2024_

We've updated Evaluation Reports to give you more control over the releases you evaluate. Previously, you could only add the latest release of a Deployment to your reports. Now, you can select specific releases by their tag, allowing you to compare different versions within your Evaluation Reports.

## Workflow Sandbox Latency

_August 9th, 2024_

You can now view the latency of Workflow Sandboxes and their Nodes. To enable viewing latency click the Workflow Sandbox settings gear icon in the top right and turn on the "View Latency" option.

## Prompt Sandbox Cost Tracking

_August 9th, 2024_

You can now see the dollar cost of a Prompt's execution within both a Prompt Sandbox's Prompt Editor and Comparison Mode views.
These costs are calculated using model providers' publicly available pricing data in conjunction with the number of input/output tokens used.

![Prompt Sandbox Comparison With Cost Tracking](https://storage.cloud.google.com/vellum-public/help-docs/changelogs/2024-08/prompt_sandbox_comparison_with_cost_tracking.png)

If you're curious about a given model's pricing, you can view details in the Model's detail page.
![MLModel Detail Page with Billing Config](https://storage.cloud.google.com/vellum-public/help-docs/changelogs/2024-08/mlmodel_detail_page_with_cost_config.png)
Most popular models already have pricing information populated, with support for even more models following in the coming days.
Showing cost information in Prompt Sandboxes is just the first step! We'll expose cost details throughout more of Vellum over time.

## GPT-4o 2024-08-06

_August 6th, 2024_

OpenAI's newest GPT-4o model `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` is now available in Vellum and has been added to all workspaces!

## Deployment Descriptions

_August 2nd, 2024_

You can now update your Prompt and Workflow Deployments to include a human-readable description. This is useful for giving other members of your team a high-level summary
of what the Prompt or Workflow does without needing to parse through the configuration or control flow.

![Update Deployment Description](https://storage.cloud.google.com/vellum-public/help-docs/changelogs/2024-08/update-deployment-description.png)

Once set, the description will appear as part of the Deployment Details page within the Deployment Info section:

## Evaluation Report History

_August 1st, 2024_

It used to be that you could only view the latest set of Evaluation results for a given Prompt or Workflow. But now,
you can view a history of all Evaluation runs and go back to view the results of any prior state.

![Evaluation Report History](https://storage.cloud.google.com/vellum-public/help-docs/changelogs/2024-08/evaluation-report-history.png)

This is particularly helpful if you want to do things like compare the results of two different Evaluation runs,
download the results of a past Evaluation run, or simply view the Test Cases that existed at that time.
