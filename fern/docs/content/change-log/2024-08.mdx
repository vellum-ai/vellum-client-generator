## Prompt Sandbox Cost Tracking

_August 9th, 2024_

You can now see the dollar cost of a Prompt's execution within both a Prompt Sandbox's Prompt Editor and Comparison Mode views.
These costs are calculated using model providers' publicly available pricing data in conjunction with the number of input/output tokens used.

If you're curious about a given model's pricing, you can view details in the Model's detail page.

Most popular models already have pricing information populated, with support for even more models following in the coming days.
Showing cost information in Prompt Sandboxes is just the first step! We'll expose cost details throughout more of Vellum over time.

## GPT-4o 2024-08-06

_August 6th, 2024_

OpenAI's newest GPT-4o model `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` is now available in Vellum and has been added to all workspaces!

## Deployment Descriptions

_August 2nd, 2024_

You can now update your Prompt and Workflow Deployments to include a human-readable description. This is useful for giving other members of your team a high-level summary
of what the Prompt or Workflow does without needing to parse through the configuration or control flow.

![Update Deployment Description](https://storage.cloud.google.com/vellum-public/help-docs/changelogs/2024-08/update-deployment-description.png)

Once set, the description will appear as part of the Deployment Details page within the Deployment Info section:

## Evaluation Report History

_August 1st, 2024_

It used to be that you could only view the latest set of Evaluation results for a given Prompt or Workflow. But now,
you can view a history of all Evaluation runs and go back to view the results of any prior state.

![Evaluation Report History](https://storage.cloud.google.com/vellum-public/help-docs/changelogs/2024-08/evaluation-report-history.png)

This is particularly helpful if you want to do things like compare the results of two different Evaluation runs,
download the results of a past Evaluation run, or simply view the Test Cases that existed at that time.
