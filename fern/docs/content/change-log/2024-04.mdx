## Test Suite Improvements

_April 8th, 2024_

We've made some changes to our Test Suite UX. Here's what's new:

- **Simplified Creation Process**: We've broken down the test suite creation into clear, manageable steps, ensuring a more guided and less overwhelming setup.
- **In-Context Editing**: You can now edit test suites directly from the Prompt or Workflow evaluations page via a new, sleek modal.
- **Enhanced Error Messaging**: We've revamped our error messages to be clearer and more actionable. You'll now receive specific feedback that pinpoints exactly where things went wrong.

## Prompt Editor

_April 5th, 2024_

Prompt Sandboxes have an entirely new view mode: Prompt Editor. It's a dedicated space for iterating on a single Variant and Scenario. All of the features you need to work quickly are easily accessible, and collapsible sections make it simple to free up screen space. There are even more improved experiences and exciting coming down the pike for Prompt Editor, and many of those improvements will make their way into Comparison and Chat Modes, as well.

You can now copy logit bias parameters from one Prompt Variant and paste them into another Prompt. This works in both Prompt Sandboxes and Prompt Nodes within Workflows.

## New APIs for Accessing Test Suite Runs

_April 3rd, 2024_

We have two new [APIs](/api-reference/api-reference/test-suite-runs/retrieve) available in beta for accessing your Test Suite Runs:

- A Retrieve endpoint to fetch metadata about the test suite run like it's current state at `GET /v1/test_suite_runs/{id}`
- A List executions endpoint to fetch the results of the test suite run at `GET /v1/test_suite_runs/{id}/executions`

These APIs are available on version `0.3.15` of our SDKs.
