## New APIs for Accessing Test Suite Runs

_April 3rd, 2024_

We have three new [APIs](/api-reference/api-reference/test-suite-runs) available in Beta for invoking and accessing your test suite runs:

- A Create endpoint to create new test suite runs at `POST /v1/test_suite_runs`
- A Retrieve endpoint to fetch metadata about the test suite run like it's current state at `GET /v1/test_suite_runs/{id}`
- A List executions endpoint to fetch the results of the test suite run at `GET /v1/test_suite_runs/{id}/executions`

These APIs are available on version `0.3.15` of our SDKs.
