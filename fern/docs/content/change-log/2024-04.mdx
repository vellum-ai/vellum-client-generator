## New APIs for Accessing Test Suite Runs

_April 3rd, 2024_

We have two new [APIs](/api-reference/api-reference/test-suite-runs/retrieve) available in beta for accessing your Test Suite Runs:

- A Retrieve endpoint to fetch metadata about the test suite run like it's current state at `GET /v1/test_suite_runs/{id}`
- A List executions endpoint to fetch the results of the test suite run at `GET /v1/test_suite_runs/{id}/executions`

These APIs are available on version `0.3.15` of our SDKs.
