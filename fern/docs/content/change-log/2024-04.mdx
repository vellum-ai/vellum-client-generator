## Usage Tracking in Prompt Sandbox and Prompt API

_April 9th, 2024_

We have added the ability for you to track model host usage from the `execute-prompt` [API](/api-reference/api-reference/execute-prompt#request.body.expand_meta.usage). This API update is available on version `0.3.21` of our SDKs.

You can also now view model host usage in the Prompt Sandbox by enabling the "Track Usage" toggle in your Prompt Sandbox's settings.

## Prompt Editor

_April 5th, 2024_

Prompt Sandboxes have an entirely new view mode: Prompt Editor. It's a dedicated space for iterating on a single Variant and Scenario. All of the features you need to work quickly are easily accessible, and collapsible sections make it simple to free up screen space. There are even more improved experiences and exciting coming down the pike for Prompt Editor, and many of those improvements will make their way into Comparison and Chat Modes, as well.

## New APIs for Accessing Test Suite Runs

_April 3rd, 2024_

We have two new [APIs](/api-reference/api-reference/test-suite-runs/retrieve) available in beta for accessing your Test Suite Runs:

- A Retrieve endpoint to fetch metadata about the test suite run like it's current state at `GET /v1/test_suite_runs/{id}`
- A List executions endpoint to fetch the results of the test suite run at `GET /v1/test_suite_runs/{id}/executions`

These APIs are available on version `0.3.15` of our SDKs.
