## Test Suite Improvements

_April 4th, 2024_

We've made some changes to our Test Suite UX. Here's what's new:

- **Simplified Creation Process**: We've broken down the test suite creation into clear, manageable steps, ensuring a more guided and less overwhelming setup.
- **In-Context Editing**: You can now edit test suites directly from the Prompt or Workflow evaluations page via a new, sleek modal.
- **Enhanced Error Messaging**: We've revamped our error messages to be clearer and more actionable. You'll now receive specific feedback that pinpoints exactly where things went wrong.
