title: Improve Retrieval Results with Metadata Filtering
description: Learn how to refine searches using metadata filtering for precise document retrieval. Perfect for targeted searches.
---
Some use-cases of Vellum Search require you to narrow in on a subset of documents prior to searching based on keyword match / semantic similarity. For example, you might want to search across historical conversations _for a specific user_ or only across documents _that have specific tags_.

You can do this through metadata filtering.

Metadata filtering requires that you:

1. Provide structured metadata for your documents either upon initial upload or later; and
2. Provide filter criteria when performing a search.

Let’s see how to do each.

# Specifying Metadata

You can specify metadata for documents through both the UI and API.

### Through the UI

You can provide metadata upon initial upload.

You can also view metadata associated with a document and edit it after it’s been uploaded.

### Through the API

You can provide metadata as _stringified_ JSON upon initial upload using the [upload Documents API here](https://docs.vellum.ai/api-reference/api-reference/documents/upload).

You can also update a document’s metadata after-the-fact using the the `Document - Partial Update` [endpoint here](https://docs.vellum.ai/api-reference/api-reference/documents/partial-update).

Note that in this endpoint, you can simply provide a JSON object (rather than a stringified JSON object as is required during initial upload).

## Filtering Against Metadata

You use the `search` endpoint to perform a search against an index (documented [here](https://docs.vellum.ai/api-reference/api-reference/search)). This endpoint exposes an `options.filters.metadata` field for filtering against your provided metadata prior to matching on keywords/semantic similarity.

The syntax of the `metadata` property supports complex boolean logic and was borrowed from [React Query Builder](https://react-querybuilder.js.org/). You can use their [demo here](https://react-querybuilder.js.org/demo#addRuleToNewGroups=false&autoSelectField=true&autoSelectOperator=true&debugMode=false&disabled=false&enableDragAndDrop=false&independentCombinators=false&justifiedLayout=false&listsAsArrays=false&parseNumbers=false&resetOnFieldChange=true&resetOnOperatorChange=false&showBranches=false&showCloneButtons=false&showCombinatorsBetweenRules=false&showLockButtons=false&showNotToggle=false&validateQuery=false) to get a feel for the query syntax.

Note that values for fields must be JSON-deserializable. If you're looking to filter against a string, then the value passed in should contain escaped double quotes.

### Example

Suppose you have two documents with the following metadata:

```json
// Document A
{
	"tags": [
		"customer-facing", "needs-triage", "bug"
	],
	"priority": "high"
}
// Document B
{
	"tags": [
		"needs-triage", "bug"
	],
	"priority": "low"
}
```

And you wanted to perform a search across all documents that are marked as high priority, customer-facing bugs, you would use the following query:

```json
{
		...,
		"options": {
			"filters": {
				"metadata": {
					"combinator": "AND",
					"rules": [
						{
							"field": "tags",
							"operator": "contains",
							"value": "\"customer-facing\""
						},
						{
							"field": "tags",
							"operator": "contains",
							"value": "\"bug\""
						},
						{
							"priority": "tags",
							"operator": "+",
							"value": "high"
						}
					],
					"negated": false
				}
			}
		}
}
```
