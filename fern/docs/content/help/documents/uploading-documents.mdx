Any document that you want to query against should be uploaded ahead
of time at [https://app.vellum.ai/document-indexes](https://app.vellum.ai/document-indexes).

## What is a Document Index?

Document indexes act as a collection of documents grouped together
for performing searches against for a specific use case. For example,
if you are creating a chatbot to query against OpenAI’s help center
documents, the text files of each article in the help center would be
stored in one index. Here's how it looks in Vellum's UI:

## How to upload documents?

You can manually upload files through the UI
or via [API](https://docs.vellum.ai/api-reference/documents/upload).

Each document has a `Name` and an `External ID` which are
initially populated with the name of the file that you upload.

**Name** - Human readable text which is how the document will be visible in Vellum's UI (in documents tab)

**External ID** - As the contents of a document change and the old documents becomes out of date, you can submit the updated document for reindexing re-uploading it and specifying the same \`External ID\`.
