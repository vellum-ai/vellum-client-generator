Vellum Search can be used to include relevant context in a prompt at run-time that fits within LLM token window limits. Typically, the query that produces the search results comes from an end-user.

For example, here‚Äôs a prompt used to answer questions, pulling the source materials for an answer from a document index. The remainder of this article references variables from this prompt to explain the mechanics.

## Step 1: How to add relevant context to `context_str` variable

In Vellum Playground, each variable has a **üîç**¬†icon to include search results in Playground

Clicking this button opens up a modal to return Search results for a given query. Follow these steps in the modal:

- Enter the Document Index that should be queried against
- Type the search query (note: this should be the same as the `query_str` in the prompt variable)
- Choose the number of chunks to be returned, the separators between each chunk and hit Run. By default, Vellum returns 3 chunks and uses new lines as separators.
- Clicking Apply adds these results to the `context_str` variable

## Step 2: How to use the context to get results

Copy/paste the same user query into the `query_str` variable. Hit Run on the Playground and see the results against a variety of prompts.
