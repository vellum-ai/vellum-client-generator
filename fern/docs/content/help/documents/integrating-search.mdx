Once in production, there’s a 3 step process to add search results in your queries at run-time:

1. Call Search API to obtain relevant context (details below)
2. Format the returned context and include as a single variable value when making requests to a Vellum Deployment
3. Pass search results to request endpoint while calling the LLM

For Step 3, make sure you have a variable in Vellum Playground where search results are entered. Details to set that up are here: [Running Searches in Playground](/help-center/documents/running-searches)

## Search API

There’s a code snippet for the Search API in the Document Index. There are 3 variables to call the API:

- **index_name** - Index that is searched across
- **query** - Search query (usually a user input)
- **options** - Optional configuration that drives search behavior. Namely used to 
determine the max number of results returned in the response. You can also use:
- **weights** - to change the prioritization between keyword matches vs semantic similarity
- **result_merging** - to automatically merge overlapping chunks into larger chunks without redundant content
- **filters** - to perform rule-based filtering prior to matching on keywords / semantic similarity.
