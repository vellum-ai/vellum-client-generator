All the row-level Completions found in the "Completions" tab of a Prompt Deployment can
be monitored in aggregate via the "Monitoring" tab.

This is especially useful for spotting trends in things like request volume, latency,
quality, and more. If there are other visualizations you'd like to see here, please share that feedback with us!

The charts you see can be filtered down to specific time ranges using the “Relative Date” button.
