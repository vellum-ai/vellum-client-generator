The Vellum Prompt Playground is a powerful tool for rapid iteration and
collaboration between multiple models and prompts. Save, tag,
and share your work with ease using the features outlined below.

### History

Every model-generated response and respective prompt are saved
as history items, giving you access to a detailed record of your
work. To access history items, simply activate the toggle button
located at the top right of the Playground, and all history items
will appear on the left side of your screen.

### Tracking Progress, Collaborating, and Tagging

The Playground is designed to help you iterate on prompts and model
providers until you find the perfect fit for your needs. With the
history feature, you can keep track of your team's work in an organized
way by only keeping the iterations you choose to, through the `save` button.

Everyone working on the same sandbox can see each other's history items,
and you can also tag them to keep better track of your work.
