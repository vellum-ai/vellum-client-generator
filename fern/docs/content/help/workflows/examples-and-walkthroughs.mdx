  <Accordion title="Tip: Zapier API Calls">
    Passing JSON Arrays in Zapier can be tricky. Instead, you can use Code Blocks to make it easier. 
    
    You can use the follow code snippet as inspiration for your own API calls with Zapier Code Blocks and Python.
    ```python
      import requests

      # Replace with your actual Vellum API key
      VELLUM_API_KEY = "..."

      url = "https://predict.vellum.ai/v1/execute-workflow"

      headers = {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          "X_API_KEY": VELLUM_API_KEY
      }

      data = {
          "workflow_deployment_name": "vellum-customer-support-q-a-demos",
          "release_tag": "LATEST",
          "inputs": [
              {
                  "type": "STRING",
                  "name": "question",
                  "value": input_data["user_question"] # whatever Zapier values you want to use here
              }
          ]
      }

      response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

      # Print the response from the server
      print(response.status_code)
      print(response.json())

      return response.json()
    ```
