## Generating API Keys

The Vellum API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Vellum [here](https://app.vellum.ai/api-keys).


## Authentication
Authentication is performed using headers. You should include your API key as the value associated with the `X_API_KEY` header in your requests.

Note that all API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.


## API Key Best Practices

The API keys you generate should be treated like passwords. Do not share your API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, etc.
